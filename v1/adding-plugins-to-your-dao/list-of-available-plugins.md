# List of Available Plugins

notes:

* There are plugins at the end without descriptions: what are these? Why do we also have Funding and Voting Power in V2?
* could someone confirm the contract for snglsDAO [**https://github.com/SingularDTV/snglsDAO-smartcontracts/blob/master/dao-contracts/contracts/schemes/LockingSGT4Reputation.sol**](https://github.com/SingularDTV/snglsDAO-smartcontracts/blob/master/dao-contracts/contracts/schemes/LockingSGT4Reputation.sol)
* We should probably have links to each of these contracts
  * from here maybe:
