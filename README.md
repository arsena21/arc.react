# Welcome to DAOstack!

DAOstack provides everything you need to start managing your community without a centralized authority. Here are the most important things you should know about if you aren’t familiar:

* Voting power within our DAOs are reputation based \(REP for short\), making them incredibly flexible, and more resistant to certain attacks. Voting power can be given via proposals, or through some other group like token holders if you want. 
* DAOs on our platform have a native token which they can mint via proposals \(which you don’t need to use if you don’t want to, but comes in handy for many projects!\) 
* DAOs on our platform start off with very basic features. Plugins can be added to this basic DAO which expands its capabilities.
* DAOstack DAOs use Holographic Consensus, which is a voting system with advantages over other kinds of voting mechanisms. You can read more on this here.
* V1 of our stack is our stable version. V2 of our stack is a more experimental branch, but which has many advantages from a usability and developer perspective. The documentation is organised by these two versions. 

Some of the most well known DAOs on our platform include [DXdao](https://dxdao.eth.link/), [NecDAO](https://nectar.community/dao) and [PrimeDAO](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmabBvci27gFn3C9wWzS6k2jBRCLnAHUvfwSDhZ8iZkADB/#/). You can always reach out to us on either Telegram and Discord if you have any questions about launching a DAO or of our documentation. [DAOtalk](https://daotalk.org/) is also a great place to get answers.
